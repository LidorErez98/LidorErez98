## Projects I've worked on:
- **Sberbank Housing Price Prediction**  
  Ranked 1st in class; achieved ~20% improvement using ensemble models on a Kaggle dataset  
- **Image Segmentation with U-Net**  
  Detected photovoltaic systems in satellite imagery using deep learning with custom loss functions and Dask  
- **ML & RL Learning Repository**  
  Documented concepts and implemented key algorithms from scratch in Python to reinforce understanding
